# python-challenge
This repository contains the python scripts for the Module 3 Challenge as well as the resulting analyses. 
The PyBank script looks through a company's profits and losses per month for some period of time through a CSV file. 
It will calculate the Total Months, Total (net profits/losses), Average Change, Greatest Increase and Greatest Decrease. 
The PyPoll script counts the votes of an election through a CSV file.
It will calculate Total Votes, total votes per candidate, and the winner.
Both scripts will export their finding to their respective "analysis/analysis.txt" files.
